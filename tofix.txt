Case 0:
    If the commandline is:
        ./pipex infile 'cat -e' 'cat -e' outfile
    And If outfile has no WritePermission, then
        leaks occure, and fd leaks occure

    If same commandline And infile has no ReadPermission, then
        fd leaks occure
    
    HowToFix:
        open both files (infile and outfile) in the parent process, and call
        fork() ONLY IF both have succeed

Case 1:
    If the commandline is:
        ./pipex infile '/usr/bin/cat -e' '/usr/bin/cat -e' outfile
    And If PATH is unset, then
        the commands are not found/run and a "PATH not found" message appears instead

    HowToFix:
        proceed to extract_path after trying to execute directly (absolute path to cmd only !)
        Don't forget to free the ft_split result after !
